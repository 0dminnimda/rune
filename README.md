# áš£ The Rune Programming Language
_Safer code for secure enclaves_

This is not an officially supported Google product.

Rune is an unfinished language, with an unfinished compiler, and barely a start
on the language reference manual (LRM).  Most likely, it will never be adopted
widely.  Feel free to kick tires and to evaluate the cool new security and
efficiency features of Rune, but for now, it is not recommended for any
production use case.

Rune is a systems programming language designed for security-sensitive
applications that are prone to common security flaws when implemented in
traditional systems languages such as C and C++.  Its primary goal is providing
safety features for hardware-enforced private computation such as [sealed
computation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.07841) or [secure
enclaves](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/opinions/enclaves-security-world/).
Rune's most notable security feature is constant-time processing of secrets.
Rune also aims to be faster than C++ for most memory-intensive applications, due
to its Structure-of-Array
\([SoA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AoS_and_SoA#:~:text=AoS%20vs.,AoS%20case%20easier%20to%20handle.)\)
memory management.

See documentation in [g3doc](g3doc/index.md) for more information about Rune.

## Compiling the Rune compiler:

You'll need 4 dependencies installed to compile Rune:

  - Bison (parser generator
  - Flex (lexer generator)
  - GNU multi-precision package gmp
  - Datadraw, an SoA data-structure generator for C
  - Clang version 10
The first four can be installed with one command:


    $ sudo apt-get install bison flex libgmp-dev clang-10

Installing Datadraw requires cloning the source from github, or getting it from
//third\_party/datadraw.

    $ git clone https://github.com/waywardgeek/datadraw.git
    $ sudo apt-get install build-essential
    $ cd datadraw
    $ ./autogen.sh
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

Hopefully that all goes well...  After dependencies are installed, to build
rune:

    $ git clone https://github.com/google/rune.git
    $ git clone https://github.com/pornin/CTTK.git
    $ cp CTTK/inc/cttk.h CTTK
    $ cd rune
    $ make

CTTK was written by Thomas Pornin.  It provides constant-time big-integer
arithmetic.

If `make` succeeds, test the Rune compiler in the rune directory with:

    $ ./runtests.sh

Some tests are currently expected to fail, but most should pass.  To install
rune under /usr/local/rune:

    $ sudo make install

Test your installation:

    $ echo 'println "Hello, World!"' > hello.rn
    $ rune -g hello.rn
    $ ./hello

You can debug your binary executable with gdb:

    $ gdb ./hello

TODO: add instructions on how to debug compiler itself, especially the datadraw debug functionality.
